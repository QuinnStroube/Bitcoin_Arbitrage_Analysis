# Bitcoin Arbitrage Analysis
---
## Project Summary
    The project analyzes the price of Bitcoin on two different exchanges during Q1 of 2018.
    Using data from 1/1/2018 - 3/31/2022, the project compares the Bitstamp & Coinbase exchange closing prices.
    By breaking the data set up into three time periods, you get a closer look to select three dates out of the 
    data frame to analyze for arbitrage opportunities.
